# Pok√©mon Game API

Expose an API that ranks:
- The **5 heaviest** Pok√©mon 
- The **5 highest** Pok√©mon
- The **5 Pok√©mon with the highest base experience**

Data is retrieved from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon). The system is designed following the principles of **Clean Architecture** to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## üìê Architecture Overview

## Architecture Overview

The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture with the application divided into multiple Maven modules. 

The `pokemon-game-domain` module contains domain objects representing the core business entities. The `pokemon-game-application` module holds the use cases and their implementations. The `pokemon-game-boot` module provides the Spring Boot configuration to wire everything together. The `pokemon-game-rest-api` module contains the controllers that handle HTTP requests. Lastly, the `pokemon-game-pokeapi-client` module is responsible for connecting to the external Pok√©API to fetch Pok√©mon data.

## üö´ Limitations & Tradeoffs

> These are areas identified for improvement but not yet implemented due to time constraints.

### ‚ùå Better Caching mechanism

- **Problem**: All data is fetched from Pok√©API in the first request and data retrieved is cached. However, by using a simple cache mechanism (i.e. an in-memory cache) can lead to stale data and memory issues in production.
- **Planned Solution**: Replace in-memory caching with a production-grade solution like Redis or Caffeine to enable TTL, eviction policies, and better scalability.

### ‚ùå Data loading
- **Problem**: Fetching all data from Pok√©API in the first request causes high latency and delays the API response.
- **Planned Solution**: Implement a background prefetching mechanism that periodically retrieves and stores Pok√©mon data in a database, allowing the API to serve requests quickly from the database instead of making real-time external calls.

### ‚ùå Error Handling

- **Problem**: Minimal error reporting and fallback behavior on failed external API calls.
- **Planned Solution**: Add robust exception handling, retries, and fallback strategies.

### ‚ùå Input Configuration

- **Problem**: Number of top Pok√©mon is hardcoded (top 5).
- **Planned Solution**: Make this configurable via query params.
